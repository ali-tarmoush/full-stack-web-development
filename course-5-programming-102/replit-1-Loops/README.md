# Instructions

Using rand write a program that "throws" a dice for x amount of times.

Where x is a variable in your program, while "throwing" the dice your program should store how many times each value appeared, then print the number of occurrences for each number.

For example, this program throwed a dice for 5 times and these are the values that appeared 1 5 5 6 3. which means the program will print the follwing at the end.

1 occurred 1
2 occurred 0
3 occurred 1
4 occurred 0
5 occurred 2
6 occurred 1

# Criteria

The program should have a variable that holds the number of times we should throw the dice.
We will use different values for this variable to make sure your code works correctly no matter how many times we throw the dice.
use rand to simulate a dice throw
You must print the result just like the example above.
You must write the logic twice, once with a while loop and once with a for loop.
