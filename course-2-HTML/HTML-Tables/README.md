Can you know what's wrong with the following table?

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>18</td>
            <td>London</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
            <th>City</th>
        </tr>
    </table>

- Can you fix it and write the fixed version in the index.html file?

- Can you write in the index.html the number of rows and columns (inside any html tag)?
